# NeedsBasedPlanning

An action planner that uses Maslow's needs as input for goals

The purpose of this project is to set up an implementation for "needs" in Action Planning.

The initial goal is a proof of concept, using needs as input in action planning should have a bunch of interesting effects:

-Procedural quest generation

-Active NPCs with personal goals

-Player actions impacting NPC behavior and progress.

This project uses a modified version of Brent Owens' GOAP, the original can be found here:
